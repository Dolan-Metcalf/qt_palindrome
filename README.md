# qt_palindrome

Write a program that asks the user for a palindrome in a QLineEdit, and has a validator that enforces the rule that the letters (ignoring differences in case, or whitespace) do indeed have the same order in either direction. Remember that words like Abba are palindromes â€“ they read the same forwards and backwards. Limit the maximum length of the input string to ten characters.
